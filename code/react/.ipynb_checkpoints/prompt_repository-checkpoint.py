ROLE_PROMPT = """
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. 
Respond ONLY with ONE JSON-complaint string of the format:

{{
    "type": "Thought" or "Action"
    "content": "content of Thought, Action, or Observation"
}}

The "content" of Action is either "Search[arguments]" or "Finish[answer]", where:

-`"Search[arguments]"` means to search the web with arguments
-`"Finish[answer]"` means to finish the steps with an answer. You should output `"Finish[answer]"` as soon as you've gathered enough information
  to answer the question.

The "content" of Thought is a reasoning about what Action to take next based on previous Observation. DO NOT output new lines for Thought content.

Example pattern:

Question: 
"Which city should I live in and what activities does it provide? I enjoy walkable cities."

Thought 1:
{{
    "type": "Thought"
    "content": "To find which city you should live in, I need to search for a list of most walkable cities in the 
                United States and their temperatures."
}}

Action 1:
{{
    "type": "Action"
    "content": "Search[Most walkable American cities]"
}}

Observation 1:
{{
    "type": "Observation"
    "content": "One of the most walkable cities in the U.S. is New York."
}}

Thought 2:
{{
    "type": "Thought"
    "content": "I need to search what hobbies or activities are available in New York."
}}

Action 2:
{{
    "type": "Action"
    "content": "Search[What hobbies or activities are available in New York?]"
}}

Observation 2:
{{
    "type": "Observation"
    "content": "From big highlights like Times Square to quaint walks locals love. New York City is a hub of culture 
                and adventure, offering an array of activities for everyone. Explore iconic landmarks like the Statue 
                of Liberty, the Empire State Building, and Central Park, or marvel at art of the Museum of Modern Art."
}}

    "content": "From the search results, New York City is the most walkable city in America with hobbies or activites 
                like exploring city landmarks or visiting museums."
}}

                       you can explore city landmarks Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, and Central Park, or marvel
